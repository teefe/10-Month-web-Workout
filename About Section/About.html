            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>
                I’m Katabira Derrick Teefe, a self-taught software developer passionate about creating clean, efficient, and user-centered digital solutions. My focus is on web development, where I specialize in building responsive, functional, and visually appealing websites and applications using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    
                Through structured learning with The Odin Project and freeCodeCamp, I’ve developed a strong foundation in front-end development and a growing interest in back-end technologies. I’m committed to continuous learning and applying best practices to deliver reliable, scalable solutions that meet real-world needs.
    
                I aim to collaborate with individuals and businesses looking to bring their ideas to life through technology — transforming concepts into powerful, practical software products that make an impact.
